## SkyGfx Extended

SkyGfx (Sky is name of Renderware for the PS2) brings accurate PS2 graphics to the PC version of San Andreas, Vice City and III (and now Xbox graphics to III and Vice City).

This is a Extended alternative version maintained by me (Junior_Djjr) named as "SkyGfx Extended", in short, due to this project it is an excellent base for shaders in GTA SA, so this alternative version seeks to add new shaders and modern features to the game, different from the original SkyGfx goal.

How to compile:
Define the RWSDK36 environmental variable or replace it with the path to RWSDK in premake5.lua.
For example: 

    RWSDK36: <some path>\RWSDK\RW36\Graphics\rwsdk\include\d3d9

Use premake to generate a solution.

### ReShade ROADMASK semantic (qUINT SSR integration)

This build exports a per-frame `ROADMASK` texture semantic from the internal road-path mask renderer (white = paved corridor, black = no reflection).
External ReShade shaders (such as `qUINT_ssr.fx`) can consume it like this:

```hlsl
texture texRoadMask : ROADMASK;
sampler sRoadMask { Texture = texRoadMask; };
```

Then gate SSR blend/composite by `tex2D(sRoadMask, uv).r`.
